# EmoEye: Eye Tracking Arousal and Valence Decoding using Deep Learning

**Welcome to the EmoEye GitHub repository!** This project is dedicated to the exploration of emotion decoding through eye tracking data and deep learning methodologies.

## Project Overview

Emotion detection is a cornerstone of Affective Computing, with applications spanning scientific research and commercial sectors. EmoEye was born out of the need for AI-driven analytics and leverages a vast multimodal psychophysiological database to develop an innovative Deep Learning approach for affect recognition.

## Methodology Highlights

### Data Collection
Our project is built upon a comprehensive multimodal psychophysiological database. This dataset encompasses eye-tracking data, galvanic skin response (GSR) readings, and heart-rate variability measurements.

### Deep Learning Approach
EmoEye employs advanced Deep Learning techniques to unravel emotions. Our model is designed to process a variety of data types, including scanpaths, GSR data, heart-rate signals, evoked by images viewed by participants.

## Commercial Endeavors

EmoEye stands as an entrepreneurial endeavor in the realm of Affective Computing. Our approach diverges from the commonly used facial recognition methods, embracing psychophysiology and eye-tracking to yield tangible results. The EmoEye neural network has already been successfully applied in commercial research settings. Moreover, we are actively working on developing EmoEye-based solutions for diverse forms of emotional content, such as articles and videos.
